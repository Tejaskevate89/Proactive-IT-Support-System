# Proactive IT Support System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Proactive IT Support System** is designed to detect and resolve IT issues before they impact users. By leveraging machine learning and data analytics, the system predicts potential failures and automates troubleshooting, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Identifies potential system failures in advance.
- **Automated Issue Resolution**: Recommends or executes fixes autonomously.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks system performance and detects anomalies.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Provides insights and alerts to IT administrators.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Continuously learns and improves accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Backend**: Flask/Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tejaskevate89/Proactive-IT-Support-System.git
   cd Proactive-IT-Support-System
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate  # For Django
   ```

   ```bash
   python app.py  # Flask
   python manage.py runserver  # Django
   ```

## 📊 Usage
1. Start the application.
2. Monitor real-time logs for system anomalies.
3. View predictive insights and suggested resolutions.
4. Automate issue resolution with predefined scripts.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
